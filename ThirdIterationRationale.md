# Main goal

To build a 3D (Q-bic) TicTacToe online, first I want to create the API, and then focus on the UI

## Task list

- Create the Q-bic board, with React & Three.js
- Add logic to place a mark on the board (X or O)
- ~~Send move to backend~~ Change how players connect to make the game multiplayer
- Test
- Adjust/Fix bugs

## Limit (Outside the scope)

Building test artifacts are outside of the task list for 2 reasons:

1. The backend is ready to receive moves, which will serve as an test elements.
2. Three.js is new for me and I don't know how to user, neither how to test it.

## Further iterations

- Publish it online.
- Improve the [README][1]
- Create a deploy pipeline
